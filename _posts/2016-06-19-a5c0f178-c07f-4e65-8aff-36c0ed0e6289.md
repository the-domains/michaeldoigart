  by years of wind and rain to gentle hills, are whittled down to manageable
  undertakings.

# Artist Statement

I grew up in West Virginia, and ever since I was a child, I've been inspired by the complex geology, geography, and history of Appalachia. As a painter, I make work that seeks to reflect those ideas. The way I paint mimics the geological process of erosion, as I work with saturated paint that is allowed to drip freely, distorting and obscuring forms and details, reflecting the way that time and erosion work to obfuscate our memories. Yet, while erosion is a process of removal, it can sometimes expose us to new forms and ideas. Things that were hidden are uncovered, and impossible tasks, like mountains worn down by years of wind and rain to gentle hills, are whittled down to manageable undertakings.
